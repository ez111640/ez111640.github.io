Hello! I'm Erica, software engineer with education in back end and front end development. I'm especially passionate about back end development and what I really love about software development is that there's never a point at which you're done learning. I love acquiring new skills and knowledge and I'm a huge fan of tackling new challenges. I'm happy to be a part of an industry that is never static and always changing.

One of my favorite projects is Harvest, a solo project that brings people's ideas and goals to life by allowing them to search by topic, navigate directly to the sources of those topics, organize their ideas or goals by board, and even create their own snapshots of ideas. I'm really interested in self-sufficiency and hobby farming, so this website caters directly toward those with a similar passion. I wish I had this website available to me when I was first getting into things like quail farming, canning and preserving, and sustainable gardening.

I also really enjoyed working together with three other developers to make our idea for Itsy come to life. It's a spin on Etsy, a website that allows people to list, sell, and browse homemade products. The catch? Everything on Itsy is... well, itsy bitsy. Miniature items only. It was a fun project that allowed each of us to showcase our unique skills as well as our ability to work together. We grow and maintain this project together and I'm thrilled to share the product of our collaboration.
